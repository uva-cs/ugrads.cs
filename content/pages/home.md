Spring 2018 specific links
------------------------

- [Lou's List: CS courses for spring 2018](http://rabi.phys.virginia.edu/mySIS/CS2/page.php?Semester=1182&Type=Group&Group=CompSci)
- [CS 4501 course descriptions](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~cohoon//years/2018/2018-spring-4501s/) for the spring 2018 semester
- [CS Course Enrollment Dates](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1r6q1_2A1sP9cTFlWsUAf8_zJnUfla6syaBenICYe7ac/edit) for when various groups of students can register


General links
-------------

- [Information for New Undergraduate Computing Majors](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~sherriff/newcs/): read this is you have just been accepted into the major
- [Possible undergraduate research projects](http://ugresearch.cs.virginia.edu/) for those who want to get involved in undergraduate research, or those looking for a senior thesis topic
    - A [list of CS faculty](https://engineering.virginia.edu/departments/computer-science/cs-people/faculty) who are the ones who posted those topics
- [Computer Science Grad Student Job Application & Interview Guide](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~weimer/grad-job-guide/guide/index.html) by [Westley Weimer](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~weimer/)


Academic links
--------------

- [CS Undergraduate handbook](http://handbook.cs.virginia.edu/ugrad-handbook.pdf) (PDF); this is hosted in a [github repo](https://github.com/uva-cs/ugrad-handbook/) (chapter 6 has information about the Masters program)
- [CS Advising dashboard](http://stardock.cs.virginia.edu/advising/) is a overview of the topics and questions that often come up during student advising
- [CS departmental academic pages](https://engineering.virginia.edu/departments/computer-science/academics), which gives an overview of the majors and minor within the department
- [Lou's List for Computer Science](http://rabi.phys.virginia.edu/mySIS/CS2/page.php?Type=Group&Group=CompSci) which lists the courses offered for each semester
- [Generic CS department class registration policy](https://engineering.virginia.edu/departments/computer-science/academics/computer-science-undergraduate-programs/registration) which is the policy used when allowing students to enroll in courses
- Placement exams and AP/IB credit: a quick overview is section of the [CS Undergraduate handbook](http://handbook.cs.virginia.edu/ugrad-handbook.pdf) (section 7.3.3); also see the pages specific to [CS 1110 placement exams](https://cs1110.cs.virginia.edu/whichcs1.html) and [CS 2110 placement exams](http://cs1110.cs.virginia.edu/CS2110-Placement-Test-Info-aug2016.pdf) (PDF); note that placement exams allow one to skip a pre-req; they *never* give course credit
- The undergraduate record for the [BS CS](http://records.ureg.virginia.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=43&poid=5227), [BA CS](http://records.ureg.virginia.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=43&poid=5226), and the [BS CpE](http://records.ureg.virginia.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=43&poid=5225)
- BA CS integration electives: there are two separate lists: the [one on the departmental website](https://engineering.virginia.edu/departments/computer-science/academics/ba-computer-science#accordion67812), and the one in section 3.3.3 of the [CS Undergraduate handbook](http://handbook.cs.virginia.edu/ugrad-handbook.pdf).  The BA CS committee is working on synchronizing those two lists, but that will likely not happen until the fall of 2017.  Until then, students may take any course on either of those two lists, and it will count as an integration elective.
    - Can a course not on the list count?  Other students have made such petitions, so it's possible a course you're interested in has been successfully petitioned (or unsuccessfully petitioned) by another student.  
The [list at this link](https://goo.gl/rPQGzW) courses for which students' petitions have been approved, and a also courses for which we've said "no”.
    - If you want one of these to count for you, you must complete the [form at this link](https://goo.gl/forms/yukq3PC6oQxh25LY2).
    - Use this same form if you want to petition for a course that’s not on any list.  See the form for information about what might count and what justification you must provide.
- Transfer credits for CS classes taken elsewhere: see [here](http://ascs8.eservices.virginia.edu/asEquivs) for a search form for the College, and [here](http://www.seas.virginia.edu/undergrad/pdfs/Transfer_Equivalents_2017.pdf) for a PDF from the Engineering school.  Students still need to complete a form before they take the course (see Jesse Rogers or Joe Rehder in the Engineering undergraduate office)
- Information about a 5-Year Masters Plan: [https://engineering.virginia.edu/departments/computer-science/academics/admissions/cs-graduate-admission/fifth-year-masters-faq](https://engineering.virginia.edu/departments/computer-science/academics/admissions/cs-graduate-admission/fifth-year-masters-faq)
