Fall 2017 specific links
------------------------

These are the links that change each semester.

- [Class registration dates for fall 2017](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yO90x1yMk0goI5-3qz9BRUHqkVrzezF2bFc1tLMlsO8/edit?usp=sharing): this is when the courses open for the various categories of students (majors, minors, non-majors/minors, etc.)
- [CS 4501 course descriptions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1giOPnf8G2ejB_N6mwcUoUgQ4uJZVHGmvz_PpUJgc-hk/edit?usp=sharing) for the fall 2017
- [TA application link](https://goo.gl/forms/oiNUilIvP2VEQWE72) for fall 2017

General links
-------------

- [Information for New Undergraduate Computing Majors](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~sherriff/newcs/): read this is you have just been accepted into the major
- [Possible undergraduate research projects](http://ugresearch.cs.virginia.edu/) for those who want to get involved in undergraduate research, or those looking for a senior thesis topic
- [Computer Science Grad Student Job Application & Interview Guide](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~weimer/grad-job-guide/guide/index.html) by [Westley Weimer](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~weimer/)

Academic links
--------------

- [CS Undergraduate handbook](http://handbook.cs.virginia.edu/ugrad-handbook.pdf) (PDF); this is hosted in a [github repo](https://github.com/uva-cs/ugrad-handbook/)
    - Chapter 6 has information about the Masters program
- [CS Advising dashboard](http://stardock.cs.virginia.edu/advising/) is a overview of the topics and questions that often come up during student advising
- [CS departmental academic pages](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/acad/), which gives an overview of the majors and minor within the department
- [Lou's List for Computer Science](http://rabi.phys.virginia.edu/mySIS/CS2/page.php?Type=Group&Group=CompSci) which lists the courses offered for each semester
- [Generic CS deptartment class registration policy](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/acad/registration.html) which is the policy used when allowing students to enroll in courses
- Placement exams and AP/IB credit: a quick overview is section of the [CS Undergraduate handbook](http://handbook.cs.virginia.edu/ugrad-handbook.pdf) (section 7.3.3); also see the pages specific to [CS 1110 placement exams](https://cs1110.cs.virginia.edu/whichcs1.html) and [CS 2110 placement exams](http://cs1110.cs.virginia.edu/CS2110-Placement-Test-Info-aug2016.pdf) (PDF); note that placement exams allow one to skip a pre-req; they *never* give course credit
- The undergraduate record for the [BS CS](http://records.ureg.virginia.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=42&poid=4962), [BA CS](http://records.ureg.virginia.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=42&poid=4961), and the [BS CpE](http://records.ureg.virginia.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=42&poid=4960)
- BA CS integration electives: there are two separate lists: the [one on the departmental website](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/acad/ba/integration.html), and the one in section 3.3.3 of the [CS Undergraduate handbook](http://handbook.cs.virginia.edu/ugrad-handbook.pdf).  The BA CS committee is working on synchronizing those two lists, but that will likely not happen until the fall of 2017.  Until then, students may take any course on either of those two lists, and it will count as an integration elective.
    - Note that it may be the case that a student will have to get a SIS exception entered if it does not count it automatically; contact [Tom Horton](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/people/faculty/horton.html) for this
    - There is also a separate list of [courses that students have petitioned about and that we have approved](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1W16TtWEcJrNgD0dFPnFpN6gjk4z2aMed4cE2g-IfSKE/edit#gid=0) -- you will also have to get a SIS exception entered for any of these courses
