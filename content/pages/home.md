**Note:** The information about degree requirements contained on this website is for informational purposes only.

Information for Spring 2020
---------------------------

The CS department is treating the Spring 2020 version of CR and GC as follows:

- CR will meet any requirement a C would meet
- GC will meet any requirement a D would meet
- NC will not meet any requirement

This applies to all CS course prereqs and all CS-administered degrees programs (BACS, BSCS, and CS minor), regardless of the department offering the course.

> **Example:** CS 4102 lists its prerequisite as  "CS 2102 and 2150 with grades of C- or higher, and APMA 1090 or MATH 1210 or MATH 1310."
This means:
>
> - You need a C- or higher or a CR in CS 2102 to take 4102
> - You need a C- or higher or a CR in CS 2150 to take 4102
> - You need a D- or higher or a GR or CR in any one of APMA 1090 or MATH 1210 or MATH 1310 to take 4102
>
> If 4102 is required for your degree (as it is for the BACS and BSCS), you need to earn a D- or better, or a CR or GC, to meet that requirement.

If you are taking a CS course to fulfill a requirement for a degree program administered by another department, please see that department's policy on GC grades, which may differ from the above.

The above only applies to the Spring 2020 redefinition of CR/NC. If you have a CR grade from a course prior to Spring 2020 and you wish it to count toward some requirement, please contact your academic advisor.

- [CS departmental academic pages](https://engineering.virginia.edu/departments/computer-science/academics), which gives an overview of the majors and minor within the department
- [Lou's List for Computer Science](http://rabi.phys.virginia.edu/mySIS/CS2/page.php?Type=Group&Group=CompSci) which lists the courses offered for each semester

- [CS Grading Guidelines](//ugrads.cs.virginia.edu/grading-guidelines.html) as approved by the CS faculty to help normalize grading practices across CS courses
- Placement exams and AP/IB credit: a quick overview is section of the [CS Undergraduate handbook](http://handbook.cs.virginia.edu/ugrad-handbook.pdf) (section 7.3.3); also see the pages specific to [CS 1110 placement exams](http://stardock.cs.virginia.edu/seas/CS1110-PlacementTestInfo-2019.pdf) (PDF) and [CS 2110 placement exams](http://stardock.cs.virginia.edu/seas/CS2110-PlacementTestInfo-2019.pdf) (PDF); note that placement exams allow one to skip a pre-req; they *never* give course credit.

- BA CS integration electives: See [this document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rHhgqbZsCAGbNWcm-l7PZbdMOleLRJg4ABl1aYHAt9s/edit#gid=0) which has the current list, as well the list that was in effect before Fall 2019. This page also explains which lists apply to students, which depends on when they were admitted into the BACS degree program.
    - Can a course not on the list count?  Other students have made such petitions, so it's possible a course you're interested in has been successfully petitioned (or unsuccessfully petitioned) by another student.  
The document at the link above shows courses for which students' petitions have been approved, and a also courses for which we've said "no‚Äù.
    - As of 9/2/2019, we are still revising the form and the petition process by which you can request that one of these peititoned courses be counted, or to petition a course not on that list.  Stay patient and stay tuned!
- Transfer credits for CS classes taken elsewhere: see [here](http://ascs8.eservices.virginia.edu/asEquivs) for a search form for the College, and [here](http://www.seas.virginia.edu/undergrad/pdfs/Transfer_Equivalents_2017.pdf) for a PDF from the Engineering school.  Students still need to complete a form before they take the course (see Jesse Rogers or Joe Rehder in the Engineering undergraduate office)
