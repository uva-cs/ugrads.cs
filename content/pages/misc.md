# Can I get credit for my internship?

The UVA rules about this are in the section “Academic Departments” on this page: <https://career.virginia.edu/internship/academic-credit>

Summarizing, internships do not result in credit, but if professors can add credit to an internship via the course UNST 2820. However, that course must require significant *additional* work (research, papers, etc) beyond the internship work itself.

In practice, CS faculty almost never offer UNST 2820 as it is extra (i.e. unrewarded) work for the instructor, with little (i.e., non-CS credit) benefit for students. The most common exception is if the work fits into a faculty member’s established research area and would help you join with the faculty member’s other research students.
