This page has the archive of the emails that were (or will be) sent to the [cs-capstone email list](https://lists.virginia.edu/sympa/info/cs-capstone) for the spring 2021 semester.  The emails are generally (but not always) sent out on the Monday of each respective week.


### <a name='week2'>Week 1 (week of Mon, Feb 1st)</a>

Hi, all,

Welcome to the start of the spring semester!

I'm writing about the process for the BS CS capstone.  You can read more about it at the main capstone information page at [http://ugrads.cs.virginia.edu/capstone.html](http://ugrads.cs.virginia.edu/capstone.html).  The quick version is that you will determine a project, select a group or decide to do it individually, and be assigned faculty advisors.  You'll complete the capstone process, including writing the technical report, throughout the semester.

My job is to guide you through the process.  I'll be the one matching you up with faculty advisors, and emailing you regularly to ensure you are on track and you know what has to be done next.  My goal is to email an update every Monday -- this email will count for tomorrow's weekly email.

<b>ACTION REQUIRED:</b> start thinking about what type of project you will want to complete, and whether you want to work alone or in a group.  To ensure we stay on track, you will need to have these decisions made in just over 2 weeks time.  Example projects can be found at the [main capstone information page](http://ugrads.cs.virginia.edu/capstone.html).  Note that working in a group does not mean completing less (or more) work per person.

The schedule of what is to be done when can be viewed at the [main capstone information page](http://ugrads.cs.virginia.edu/capstone.html).  A log of all of these emails can be found at [http://ugrads.cs.virginia.edu/capstone_emails.html](http://ugrads.cs.virginia.edu/capstone_emails.html).  (You can also view the weekly emails I sent out last semester [here](http://ugrads.cs.virginia.edu/capstone_emails_fall2020.html), but note that the content will likely be different this semester).

We have a fairly tight schedule that we will have to keep to as we reach the end of the semester.  In particular, you will have a hard deadline to get everything completed by so that we can enter the SIS exceptions into your record so that you can graduate.  This will be made clear as we approach the end of the semester.

Speaking of SIS exceptions, there was a bit of a hiccup about that.  You can read the details on the [main capstone information page](http://ugrads.cs.virginia.edu/capstone.html) under the "Capstone and SIS graduation requirements" header.  This is why you are getting the "requirements not satisfied" notifications from Jesse Rogers.  It's a headache for all involved, but we'll get through it.  In particular, we will be manually checking each of your SIS records to ensure that the only requirement you still need to fulfill is this capstone process.  This will take some time, as there are over 100 people who are completing their capstone this semester, but we'll get it done before the course add deadline.

I have created a Collab workspace that has a Piazza forum that people can use to try to find teammates; note that working in a group is not required (nor is it less work). In an effort to not clog your inbox with unwanted email (Piazza loves to do that), I did not add any of you to the workspace, but you can add yourself to the Collab workspace -- and thus Piazza -- via [this link](https://collab.its.virginia.edu/portal/site/ef58f425-8e91-45d5-b891-e13cf0094778).  The Piazza workspace is intended for you to find other people to work with; I'm not going to be monitoring it or answering questions to it.

I hope everybody is staying healthy!

Best,

### <a name='week2'>Week 2 (week of Mon, Feb 8th)</a>

Hi, all,

I hope your semesters are starting off well!  Some notes and updates:

- My plan is to email this list once a week, ideally on Mondays, to keep everybody updated with what's going on, due dates, upcoming schedule, etc.  My intent is that this is often enough to keep everything on track without inundating your inboxes with emails from me.  There will be occasional non-Monday emails as well, but hopefully there will be few of those.
- If you are planning on doing the capstone this fall, then I hope you are able to use this week to generate an idea for your capstone.  You can see possible capstone projects categories on the [capstone page](http://ugrads.cs.virginia.edu/capstone).  Recall that a capstone project has to somehow combine two CS electives.  Pick a project or idea that interests you and go for it.
- There is a [Collab workspace](https://collab.its.virginia.edu/portal/site/ef58f425-8e91-45d5-b891-e13cf0094778) that you are welcome to join if you want to try to find a capstone group.  The main feature of that workspace is a Piazza forum that you can use to find others to work with.  This is completely optional, but is a venue for finding groups.  Keep in mind that capstones can be done individually as well, and the work load does not decrease with increasing group size.
- Pretty much all of you got a notice from Jesse Rogers about not having completed the requirements for graduation due to missing a capstone.  We are working through these for each of you (we have a list of those students in that category), and will be back in touch BEFORE next Monday (as Monday is the add deadline).  We may be able to generate a report of those who are missing more than just the capstone requirement, and email those separately.  Either way, you'll receive another email, either via this list or individually, making your status clear.
- Next week I'm going to be sending out a survey that all those who want to do the capstone this semester will have to fill out.  The survey will ask what two courses you plan to combine in your capstone, who you want to work with (or if you want to work individually), etc.  Sending this out next week is in line with the original schedule, which is on the [capstone page](http://ugrads.cs.virginia.edu/capstone).  The week after I'll release the faculty reviewer assignments, and then we can work through the abstract submission; information on how to write and submit the abstract will be forthcoming when we get to that point.

### <a name='week3'>Week 3 (week of Mon, Feb 15th)</a>

Hi, all,


Welcome to week 3 of the semester! Some capstone updates:

-    Time to fill out the project matching survey!  Please fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd-oakuTVvQfyunnNrtemHB4NDy3jnPkry4l-fSHbp5EAu38Q/viewform) with the information about your proposed capstone topic.  You have a bit of time to get this filled out, but it will have to be done by the end of next Monday.
- We have checked through everybody's graduation requirements.  If you are missing something, either CS capstone related or otherwise, then you will have already received an email from myself or Jesse Rogers.  There were only three students who may be missing the extra elective, and I just emailed them this afternoon.  If you didn't receive such an email, then you are all set.
-    Recall that all the capstone information is shown at [http://ugrads.cs.virginia.edu/capstone](http://ugrads.cs.virginia.edu/capstone), and we are currently on track with the timeline listed there.
-    For your STS 4600 classes, you will have two assigned faculty reviewers in a week or two, and one of them will be the designated one to be listed as your technical advisor.


That's all I have for now. Stay healthy, everybody!


Best,

### <a name='week4'>Week 4 (week of Mon, Feb 22nd)</a>

Hi, all,

Here's the weekly capstone update for this week! I hope everybody is staying healthy and safe.

If you are completing the capstone process this spring, you will need to fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd-oakuTVvQfyunnNrtemHB4NDy3jnPkry4l-fSHbp5EAu38Q/viewform) **by the end of the day today.** Tomorrow morning I'm going to start the faculty matching process. I hope to have that completed by the end of this week.

Some students have indicated that they do not understand the STS 4500/4600 process or what is required for the completion of the senior thesis. I have put my understanding of it below in an effort to help clarify the process. KEEP IN MIND that I am faculty in computer science, not STS, so anything that they say overrides anything that I say.

That's all for now.  I hope to have the faculty matches soon.  Next week's email will contain information how to contact your faculty advisor and proceed with submitting your abstract.

Best,
-Aaron Bloomfield



**The STS 4500/4600 process:** first, a disclaimer: I am faculty in computer science, not STS, so anything that they say overrides anything that I say; I am providing this to help alleviate confusion.


While the course goals of STS 4500 and 4600 are numerous, among other things they will guide you through the process of completing your senior thesis. To successfully finish STS 4600, you will need to complete your **senior thesis binder**, which will consist of three main components: a *prospectus*, a *STS thesis*, and a *technical report*. Note that the STS department may use slightly different names for everything, but the concepts should all be the same.

-    The *prospectus* is what you complete(d) in STS 4500, and it is where you propose a research project and perform the background work to ensure that it's a realistic idea, is asking a valid question, it will contribute to society, etc.
-    The *STS thesis* is what you complete in STS 4600. This is where you perform the investigation research proposed in the prospectus, which may largely involve looking up information in libraries or online.
    -        There is a naming problem here -- the term "senior thesis" means this entire process, and to fulfill that you have to complete the senior thesis binder. The "STS thesis" is what you complete in STS 4600. The fact that they both have the word "thesis" in it causes a lot of confusion. I will always put the prefix of "senior" or "STS" in front of the word "thesis" to help clarify which one I'm talking about.
    -        While technically the topic of your prospectus and your STS thesis do not have to be the same, they often are -- and it will likely be easiest if they are.
-    The *technical report* is what you write with your home department (dual majors just choose one). This is written with, and approved by, your faculty technical advisor.
    -        In a perfect world, your technical project will directly relate to the topic you choose for your prospectus and STS thesis. But if they don't -- which is often the case -- you will have to write a document that describes how they relate. This is the socio-technical synthesis. I have seen a lot of ... creativity ... with these documents.

These three main components are combined with a few other one or two page documents (cover, signature page, socio-technical synthesis, etc.) to form the full senior thesis binder. This binder is required to be completed in order to successfully complete (i.e., pass) STS 4600. In the past, this had to actually be printed and bound, but I suspect it's all being done via a PDF these days.
