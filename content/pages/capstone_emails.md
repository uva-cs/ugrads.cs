Hi, all,

Welcome to the start of the spring semester!

I'm writing about the process for the BS CS capstone.  You can read more about it at the main capstone information page at [http://ugrads.cs.virginia.edu/capstone.html](http://ugrads.cs.virginia.edu/capstone.html).  The quick version is that you will determine a project, select a group or decide to do it individually, and be assigned faculty advisors.  You'll complete the capstone process, including writing the technical report, throughout the semester.

My job is to guide you through the process.  I'll be the one matching you up with faculty advisors, and emailing you regularly to ensure you are on track and you know what has to be done next.  My goal is to email an update every Monday -- this email will count for tomorrow's weekly email.

<b>ACTION REQUIRED:</b> start thinking about what type of project you will want to complete, and whether you want to work alone or in a group.  To ensure we stay on track, you will need to have these decisions made in just over 2 weeks time.  Example projects can be found at the [main capstone information page](http://ugrads.cs.virginia.edu/capstone.html).  Note that working in a group does not mean completing less (or more) work per person.

The schedule of what is to be done when can be viewed at the [main capstone information page](http://ugrads.cs.virginia.edu/capstone.html).  A log of all of these emails can be found at [http://ugrads.cs.virginia.edu/capstone_emails.html](http://ugrads.cs.virginia.edu/capstone_emails.html).  (You can also view the weekly emails I sent out last semester [here](http://ugrads.cs.virginia.edu/capstone_emails_fall2020.html), but note that the content will likely be different this semester).

We have a fairly tight schedule that we will have to keep to as we reach the end of the semester.  In particular, you will have a hard deadline to get everything completed by so that we can enter the SIS exceptions into your record so that you can graduate.  This will be made clear as we approach the end of the semester.

Speaking of SIS exceptions, there was a bit of a hiccup about that.  You can read the details on the [main capstone information page](http://ugrads.cs.virginia.edu/capstone.html) under the "Capstone and SIS graduation requirements" header.  This is why you are getting the "requirements not satisfied" notifications from Jesse Rogers.  It's a headache for all involved, but we'll get through it.  In particular, we will be manually checking each of your SIS records to ensure that the only requirement you still need to fulfill is this capstone process.  This will take some time, as there are over 100 people who are completing their capstone this semester, but we'll get it done before the course add deadline.

I have created a Collab workspace that has a Piazza forum that people can use to try to find teammates; note that working in a group is not required (nor is it less work). In an effort to not clog your inbox with unwanted email (Piazza loves to do that), I did not add any of you to the workspace, but you can add yourself to the Collab workspace -- and thus Piazza -- via [this link](https://collab.its.virginia.edu/portal/site/ef58f425-8e91-45d5-b891-e13cf0094778).  The Piazza workspace is intended for you to find other people to work with; I'm not going to be monitoring it or answering questions to it.

I hope everybody is staying healthy!

Best,  
-Aaron Bloomfield
