This page has the archive of the emails that were sent to the cs-capstone email list for the fall 2020 semester.  The emails are generally (but not always) sent out on Monday of each respective week.


### <a name='week1'>Week 1 (week of Mon, Aug 24th)</a>

 Hi, all,

As promised, I have posted more details about the capstone process to the capstone page at [http://ugrads.cs.virginia.edu/capstone](http://ugrads.cs.virginia.edu/capstone).  That page also includes a timeline.  All capstone details will be on that page, and this email list will only be used for reminders and notifications.

I have created a Collab workspace that has a Piazza forum that people can use to try to find teammates; note that working in a group is not required (nor is it less work).  In an effort to not clog your inbox with unwanted email (Piazza loves to do that), I did not add any of you to the workspace, but you can add yourself to the Collab workspace -- and thus Piazza -- via [this link](https://collab.its.virginia.edu/portal/site/ef58f425-8e91-45d5-b891-e13cf0094778).

My expectation is to only email this mailing list once a week to summarize what needs to be done and by when.  This is the email is for the first week of classes.

I hope you are all staying healthy!

Best,  
-Aaron Bloomfield


### <a name='week2'>Week 2 (week of Mon, Aug 31st)</a>

Hi, all,

I hope your semesters are starting off well!  Some notes and updates:

- My plan is to email this list once a week, ideally on Mondays, to keep everybody updated with what's going on, due dates, upcoming schedule, etc.  My intent is that this is often enough to keep everything on track without inundating your inboxes with emails from me.  There will be occasional non-Monday emails as well, but hopefully there will be few of those.
- If you are planning on doing the capstone this fall, then I hope you are able to use this week to generate an idea for your capstone.  You can see possible capstone projects categories on the [capstone page](http://ugrads.cs.virginia.edu/capstone).  Recall that a capstone project has to somehow combine two CS electives.  Pick a project or idea that interests you and go for it.
- There is a [Collab workspace](https://collab.its.virginia.edu/portal/site/ef58f425-8e91-45d5-b891-e13cf0094778) that you are welcome to join if you want to try to find a capstone group.  The main feature of that workspace is a Piazza forum that you can use to find others to work with.  This is completely optional, but is a venue for finding groups.  Keep in mind that capstones can be done individually as well, and the work load does not decrease with increasing group size.
- Next week I'm going to be sending out a survey that all those who want to do the capstone this semester will have to fill out.  Keep in mind that you can always do it in the spring as well.  The survey will ask what two courses you plan to combine in your capstone, who you want to work with (or if you want to work individually), etc.  Sending this out next week is in line with the original schedule, which is on the [capstone page](http://ugrads.cs.virginia.edu/capstone).  The week after I'll release the faculty reviewer assignments, and then we can work through the abstract submission; information on how to write and submit the abstract will be forthcoming when we get to that point.


Best,

### <a name='week3'>Week 3 (week of Mon, Sep 7th)</a>

 Hi, all,

Welcome to week 3 of the semester!  Some capstone updates:

- Recall that all the capstone information is shown at [http://ugrads.cs.virginia.edu/capstone](http://ugrads.cs.virginia.edu/capstone), and we are currently on track with the timeline listed there.
- For your STS 4500 classes:
    - If you are doing the technical project this fall, then you will have two assigned faculty reviewers in a week or two, and one of them will be the designated one to be listed as your technical advisor.
    - If you are doing the technical project in the spring, then you will list **me** as your technical advisor for STS 4500 this fall, and you will list your assigned faculty reviewer as your technical advisor in the spring in STS 4600.  The technical advisors listed for STS 4500 and for STS 4600 do not have to match.
    - I am still waiting on clarification as to what you should do about listing the *topic* of your technical project if you are doing the technical report in the spring -- I've sent an email out asking about this, and will update when I receive back (right away on [Piazza via the Collab workspace](https://collab.its.virginia.edu/portal/site/ef58f425-8e91-45d5-b891-e13cf0094778/page-reset/bb5bea89-eeec-456c-ba1c-87ab3f2ac8f7), and next week via this weekly email).
- Time to fill out the project matching survey!
    - If you intend to complete the technical project ***this fall***, please fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc-aD4Ml2PSHR5I5i2cma643KpvOJhrsqY-xZS_nKoazRMY8A/viewform).
        - This has to be filled out by next Monday in order to complete this process this fall.
    - If you intend to complete the technical project ***in the spring***, please fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdUClgqRGqRWZDiCJTOYoVBaoVKKwubN9S0TElIbI0bRM_XeA/viewform).
        - This lets me know who I have to provide signatures to for their technical reports.
    - Please only fill out ONE OF THEM, not both!


That's all I have for now.  Stay healthy, everybody!  And wear those masks!!!

-Aaron Bloomfield

### <a name='week4'>Week 4 (week of Mon, Sep 14th)</a>

 Hi, all,

Here's the weekly capstone update for this week!  I hope everybody is staying healthy and safe.

- If you are completing the capstone process this fall, you will need to fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1_vEId1NTuOP6YpE6SKYuMORe7IZwwtkHpm2w5-vhkes/edit) **by the end of the day today.**  Tomorrow morning I'm going to start the faculty matching process.  I hope to have that completed by the end of this week.
- If you are completing the capstone process in the spring, you will need to fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1ZnDxw_nt0NuBfSRt6EZmSfvtmz80iHTkWCYhejAdGXk/edit).
    - Those completing it in the spring will list me as your technical advisor for STS 4500, and you will have a different (and final) faculty member assigned as your technical advisor for STS 4600.  It is not a problem that you will be listing different technical advisors for STS 4500 and STS 4600.
    - I will get in touch with you later in the semester regarding a signature (or, if I haven't gotten in touch with you by the time you need it -- since I don't actually know what the STS deadline is -- send me an email).
    - You will also have to list your technical report idea for STS 4500.  From the person in charge of the STS process, I received the following clarification on this: "those students [will] develop a hypothetical technical topic based on their own interests/what they hope to do in the spring. The topic [can] change once they [start the CS capstone process in the spring], but they won’t need to revise the prospectus to reflect the next topic."
- Some students have indicated that they do not understand the STS 4500/4600 process or what is required for the completion of the senior thesis.  I have put my understanding of it below in an effort to help clarify the process.  KEEP IN MIND that I am faculty in computer science, not STS, so anything that they say overrides anything that I say.


Best,  
-Aaron Bloomfield



**The STS 4500/4600 process:** first, a disclaimer: I am faculty in computer science, not STS, so anything that they say overrides anything that I say; I am providing this to help alleviate confusion.

While the course goals of STS 4500 and 4600 are numerous, among other things they will guide you through the process of completing your senior thesis.  To successfully finish STS 4600, you will need to complete your **senior thesis binder**, which will consist of three main components: a *prospectus*, a *STS thesis*, and a *technical report*.  Note that the STS department may use slightly different names for everything, but the concepts should all be the same.

- The *prospectus* is what you complete in STS 4500, and it is where you propose a research project and perform the background work to ensure that it's a realistic idea, is asking a valid question, it will contribute to society, etc.
- The *STS thesis* is what you complete in STS 4600.  This is where you perform the investigation research proposed in the prospectus, which may largely involve looking up information in libraries or online.
    - There is a naming problem here -- the term "senior thesis" means this entire process, and to fulfill that you have to complete the senior thesis binder.  The "STS thesis" is what you complete in STS 4600.  The fact that they both have the word "thesis" in it causes a lot of confusion.  I will always put the prefix of "senior" or "STS" in front of the word "thesis" to help clarify which one I'm talking about.
    - While technically the topic of your prospectus and your STS thesis do not have to be the same, they often are -- and it will likely be easiest if they are.
- The *technical report* is what you write with your home department (dual majors just choose one).  This is written with, and approved by, your faculty technical advisor.
    - In a perfect world, your technical project will directly relate to the topic you choose for your prospectus and STS thesis.  But if they don't -- which is often the case -- you will have to write a document that describes how they relate.  This is the socio-technical synthesis.  I have seen a lot of ... creativity ... with these documents.

These three main components are combined with a few other one or two page documents (cover, signature page, socio-technical synthesis, etc.) to form the full senior thesis binder.  This binder is required to be completed in order to successfully complete (i.e., pass) STS 4600.  In the past, this had to actually be printed and bound, but I suspect it's all being done via a PDF these days.

### <a name='week5'>Week 5 (week of Mon, Sep 21st)</a>

Hi, all,

The faculty reviewer assignments are ready.  To view them, go to the "CS Capstone" workspace and look in the Posted Feedback tool.  You also will have to start writing an abstract, which I detail below.

**Faculty reviewer assignments:** each group has been assigned two faculty reviewers, a primary and a secondary.  There is no need to contact them just yet, as we have another step (the abstract submissions) to do first.  All the people who requested to be in a group are in those groups; that information is not in the Posted Feedback tool.  And the group number listed is just an internal designation to help me keep everything straight.  I have also included what you submitted for your project description.

**Abstracts:** The next step is for you to write an abstract.  This is a summary of your project, and it should start with what you write in the Google submission form.  I put guidelines to abstract writing below.  Ideally this should be done by next Monday.

Next week you will have to submit your abstracts to a submission system, and I will have that info ready by Monday.

Best,  
-Aaron Bloomfield




__Abstract writing 101__

An abstract is a one or two paragraph summary of a paper or, in this case, of the project you want to write.  You should start with the project description that you submitted, which is also included in the Posted Feedback tool.  The abstract is meant to give an overview of the paper / project.  Although it about a project idea at this point, you are likely to use this abstract in your technical paper later in the semester.

As a start to writing an abstract, look at [this abstract writing guide](https://writing.wisc.edu/handbook/assignments/writing-an-abstract-for-your-research-paper/).  In the "contents of an abstract" section, try writing one sentence on each of those seven enumerated points.  It may be that one or two of those points may require two sentences, but not too many, as you don't want your abstract to be too long.  Then edit (and re-edit!) (and re-edit again!) the abstract until it flows smoothly and you feel it gives and overview.

A note of caution: other classes may have students write to a certain page length, or add "fluff" to a document to make it longer.  Here, "fluff" is when extra verbiage is added that does nothing to be informative but just adds length.  Of course you all would never do this, but you may have friends who have done this.  As a general rule, CS faculty tend to not like fluffy abstracts, as it's just a waste of everybody's time -- it wastes your time writing it and our time reading it.  I've made students completely rewrite their technical reports because they added it a lot of fluff.  We are looking for short, concise, and to the point.  That being said, it should still be correct English and explain everything well.  Just don't try to add length for the sake of adding length.

Lastly, keep in mind that writing a good abstract is a bit of an art form, and nobody expects you all to be experts on this, as this is likely the first abstract that you will have written.  So give it your best shot, don't stress too much over it, and I'll send out instructions on Monday about how to submit the abstracts.

I would expect that writing and editing the abstract would take an hour or two.  Your mileage may vary, of course.



### <a name='week6'>Week 6 (week of Mon, Sep 28th)</a>


Hi, all,

Sorry this update is a day late.  I explain why below, if you are interested.

**Action required:** please enter your abstracts into the form [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYyG4SisoqyeBUs3_gTKsjBEK0LUY3bk9V7YzuXVjWzihuWA/viewform).  Presumably you have been working on them since my email last week.  Keep in mind that they don't need to be perfect -- just as well polished as you are able to do.  If you haven't written it yet, then please do so ASAP.  This is not a high stress task -- neither your capstone, nor your graduation, nor your happiness and success in life will depend on the quality of this first draft, so just do your best.  See my email from last Wednesday for directions for how to write it.

Please only enter ONE form submission per team group.  **They are due by the end of this Friday (10/2).**  As you have (presumably) worked on them, it should just be a quick cut-and-paste into that form.

This weekend I will send them to the faculty, and then you can start chatting with them about the next steps -- how to start that conversation will be the subject of my update next Monday.

Best,  
-Aaron Bloomfield




The original intent was to use an actual conference submission system, such as [HotCRP](https://hotcrp.com/) (yes, it's pronounced as "hot crap").  But I don't feel that we need most of the additional features that it provides, and will just add complexity and confusion, so I decided to ditch that option.  But it took a while to figure out how to manage the various aspects internally, hence the delay in getting this week's update out on time.  That, and the fact that I was backpacking the Appalachian Trail this past weekend might have had something to do with it as well...


### <a name='week7'>Week 7 (week of Mon, Oct 5th)</a>

Hi, all,

All the abstracts have been submitted, the faculty technical advisors have been notified, and you can go ahead and contact them.  The purpose of this is to get their approval for the abstract and project -- they will help ensure it's within scope, it's reasonable, has the right amount of work, etc.  That approval should come in some form of email.  If I am not CC'ed on that email by the faculty members, please forward it onto me so that I can keep track.  Details about what to include in that email are below.

If they don't approve, then you will be working with them to specify an appropriate project.  Once you do get that approval, you should start working on the project.  This is expected to happen over the next few weeks.  We are currently in week 7 of the semester, and the timeline has this week (once you get approval) and the next three weeks (through the end of week 10) to work on the project.  Note that I will continue to regularly email you all on Mondays, but the next three emails aren't going to have much content, since that is when you will be working on the projects.

For the email, you should include the following bullet points.  PLEASE REWRITE THIS YOURSELF -- I am purposely NOT including a draft, as it's appropriate for you all to write it yourself and not copy my text.

- Introduce yourself as their technical project advisee(s)
    - You should be emailing **both**​ of the faculty technical advisees (primary and secondary)
    - If you are in a group, then this email should come from just one of you, and CC the rest of you
- Ask them if they have had a chance to look over the abstract that you submitted (they got a copy in an email from me) and what their thoughts were about it
    - They will either approve it as written, want to talk about it (at which point you can set up a Zoom call), or not approve it as is (at which point you will also have to set up a Zoom call)
- Ask them if they have any comments about the project for you

That's pretty much it -- hit all the salient ideas above, but keep it short and to the point.  And if you forget who your faculty advisors are, or what their email IDs are, you can check in the Posted Feedback tool in the "CS Capstone" workspace.

Best,  
-Aaron Bloomfield


### <a name='week8'>Week 8 (week of Mon, Oct 12th)</a>

Hi, all,

Welcome to week 8 of the semester!  We are more than half-way done with classes.

I believe that everybody is in one of four states at this point:

- **You have not yet contacted your technical advisor(s):** I'm not sure what you are waiting for, as this capstone project is not going to complete itself.
- **You have emailed your technical advisor(s), but they have not yet responded:** please email them again today.  If you haven't heard back by Wednesday evening, then let me know, and I will help ensure that they respond to you.
- **You and your technical advisor are discussing the project:** continue with those discussions, and -- presumably -- you will shortly be able to specify, and get approval for, a viable project.
- **Your technical advisor(s) have approved the project:** ensure that I was CC'ed on the approval email (if not, forward it to me), and start working on the project itself.


If none of these four states apply to you, please send me an email detailing your situation.

The schedule, from the [capstone website](http://ugrads.cs.virginia.edu/capstone), has this week and the next two weeks dedicated to working on the project.  Please don't wait until the very last minute to start working on it.

Stay healthy!

Best,  
-Aaron Bloomfield


### <a name='week9'>Week 9 (week of Mon, Oct 19th)</a>

Hi, all,

I have capstone abstract approvals from most of you.  I just sent an email to those that I do **not​** have an approved abstract for, as well as a schedule for those individuals.  If you didn't get an email from me about 5 minutes ago, then I have your abstract approval recorded.

This week and next week are for you to work on the project itself.  Once we start November, I'll be sending out instructions how to start writing up the technical report itself.  Not much else for this week's update.

Stay healthy!

Best,  
-Aaron Bloomfield

### <a name='week10'>Week 10 (week of Mon, Oct 26th)</a>

Hi, all,

We are now in week 10 of the semester!  As per the schedule found [here](http://ugrads.cs.virginia.edu/capstone), this is another week for you to work on your project.  Next week is when you'll start writing up the project to form the technical report, and I will have detailed guidelines about how to write that in next week's update.  I expect the report can be written in one week, and then sent to your faculty advisors.  They'll need a week or two to look it over.  Either they will want changes, or they will accept it as-is.  But eventually you'll have a completed technical report, and we can work on figuring out getting the signatures (also a topic to be discussed later).

Stay healthy, everybody!

Best,  
-Aaron Bloomfield


### <a name='week11'>Week 11 (week of Mon, Nov 2nd)</a>

Hi, all,

Welcome to week 11!  In theory, your projects are complete or almost complete.  Or perhaps you are going to have a really late night tonight getting to that state.

If you are doing the capstone in the spring, I'll be sending you a separate email later today, as long as you filled out the [form indicating that you are completing the capstone in the spring](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1ZnDxw_nt0NuBfSRt6EZmSfvtmz80iHTkWCYhejAdGXk/edit).

The upcoming week is for the writing of the technical report, which I detail below.  You may email it to your faculty advisors when it is ready.  HOWEVER, if it is not formatted as per the guidelines below, they have been told to reject it outright.  Note that you also have to send evidence of a successful project along with the report -- what that evidence is will depend on your particular project.

Below are the details for the writing of the report.

Stay healthy, everybody!

Best,  
-Aaron Bloomfield


<p>&nbsp;</p>


**__Technical report writing 101__**

The technical reports are to be formatted as per the ACM guidelines for articles.  Note that technical report formatting is to be determined by the technical faculty advisor.

The papers need to be formatted as per the guidelines [here](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template).  You can use Word or LaTeX; most of you will use the former.  If you are using Word, then you want to use the [Interim layout.docx](https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/publications/word_style/interim-template-style/interim-layout.docx) file on that site.  This format is two-column, single spaced, size 10 font, standard margins, 5-6 pages, and will be somewhere between 4,000 to 5,000 words.

You are welcome to use a group editing site (Google Docs, etc.) to edit the content, just be sure to put it in that format when it's done.  You will also want to send along a PDF when you send it to your faculty advisors.  Also note that your references need to be in the format specified in that template.

The paper audience is other computer scientists -- so you don't need to explain what a database system is, for example.  You can assume that any readers of the paper have a degree in CS or -- like all of you -- are about to graduate with a degree in CS.

Please don't include any fluff.  Fluff is when you add BS to the paper to make it longer.  You should not have problems getting the length required.  And if it's short, it's better to leave it short than add in fluff.  Many faculty will reject it outright if it contains fluff -- I know I would

Below is a list of the sections of the paper.  Depending on your particular project, your list of sections may vary somewhat.

- **Abstract:** this is what you got approved by your faculty advisor a few weeks ago.  Minor edits are fine, but you should check with your advisor if you are making any significant changes to it.
- **CCS concepts and keywords:** you should remove these sections
- **Introduction:** Describe the problem faced that the project seeks to fix.  How is this project solved currently?  How long does it take with the current solutions? What problems does the current way of solving it cause?  We are setting the stage for how and why your project will be beneficia.
- **Background:** What do they need to know to understand the project?  Likely information about the domain that it's in, as well as the technologies used.  Keep in mind that the audience is computer scientists, so you don't need to go into detailed explanations about the technologies.  This section may be quite short -- or even removed -- depending on your particular project.
- **Related work:** what other systems exist that do similar things? Are they custom written, or generic? Why don't they fit the bill?  This gives a context of what else is out there, so that one can understand where your system fits into everything.  Literature review projects will list other literature reviews or summaries of the research area here.
- **System design:** how was the system (project) designed?  This should focus on two primary aspects: the overall system architecture (no low-level details!) and interesting/challenging/etc. design decision.  This will likely be the largest section, likely also with sub-sections.  Literature review projects will detail the various articles being reviewed here.
- **Procedure:** If appropriate; this may be removed from your report if not appropriate.  How does the customer use the system?  How do other stakeholders use the system?
- **Results:** The system solved some problem – what are the results of that?  There should be some evidence that this project fixed some problem -- present that evidence.  We aren't looking for a scientific study, so anecdotal evidence here is fine.  Get a couple of friends to try out the system, and ask them what they think of it.  Example: "The scheduler allowed the customer to prepare a schedule in 30 minutes, where it took 3 hours before."  Literature reviews will likely not have this section.
- **Conclusions:** Summarize your article and your work: "We designed a system to meet the need of problem X."  Summarize (and repeat) the relevant results that make the system look good.  Literature reviews will summaries the common themes of the articles being reviewed.
- **Future work:** If you had a full-time job for an entire year to work on this system -- and only this system -- what features would you add?  If you make this section too long, it will make it look like you didn't do anything on the project.  So maybe 1/2 of a column at most.
- **References:** They need to look like the references in the template.


__Other stuff to include__

 - Feel free to add (or remove) sections -- what is listed here are just suggestions. 
     - Indeed, some of the sections are not appropriate for all projects
     - But most of the projects will have all of those sections, although not everybody will have background and procedure.
 - Longer sections should include sub-sections
 - Screen shots
     - Screen shots, images, etc., are fine -- but this is not a picture book, so use these sparingly
     - The article is not a picture book, but a screen shot or two is not unreasonable, as this can make it easier for the reader to visualize what is going on
     - Total screen shot usage should not take up more than 1/2 page, total


__Stuff to remove__

In the templates, there are a few items that we do not need:

 - The license block (very bottom of the 1st column on the first page)
 - General terms and Subject Descriptions (likely not present)
 - CCS categories
 - Keywords
