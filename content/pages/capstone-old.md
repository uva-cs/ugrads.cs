# Older capstone details

Note: If you are a BACS major then you have no capstone requirement, so none of this information applies to you. You may, however, do a capstone-like project to earn a [distinguished major](https://engineering.virginia.edu/departments/computer-science/academics/computer-science-undergraduate-programs/ba-computer-science#accordion67814).

##What is a Capstone?
Every Engineering student must complete a capstone project to complete their degree. In CS, these projects are typically either a research project or a software development project, but other kinds of projects may be acceptable as well. 

##How do I satisfy the Capstone Requirement?
There are two components to your capstone: the technical portion and the STS portion. The STS portion is satisfied by STS4600, it cannot be completed earlier than your technical portion (and typically they are completed during the same semester).

There are two courses in the CS department which satisfy the technical portion: **CS4971 (Capstone Practicum II)**, and **CS4980 (Capstone Research)**. The practicum is a more structured course which guides you and your team through a software project, Capstone Research is more of an independent study. 


#Capstone Practicum

###How does it work?

The practicum is a two-course sequence: CS4970 (Capstone Practicum I) and CS4971 (Capstone Practicum II). CS4970 is offered every fall (and only during the fall), and counts as one of your five required CS electives. CS4971 is offered every spring (and only during the spring), and satisfies the capstone requirement. 

In CS4971 you will complete the same project that you began in CS4970. For this reason, you may only take CS4971 if you took CS4970 the fall of the same academic year (i.e. the immediately preceding fall).

###How do I enroll?

**To graduate in the spring:** sign up for CS4970 in the fall of your last academic year. (e.g. If you are graduating in the spring of your fourth year, take CS4970 in the fall of your fourth year. If you are graduating in the spring of your third year, take CS4970 in the fall of your third year.)

**To graduate in the fall:** sign up for CS4970 in the fall of the academic year before your graduation. (e.g. If you wish to graduate in the fall of your fourth year, take CS4970 in the fall of your third year.)

#Capstone Research

###How does it work?
You may satisfy this requirement by completing 3 total credits of CS4980 with any CS faculty member who agrees to be your advisor. These credits must be taken with the same faculty member, but need not be taken during the same semester. You may, for example, take 1 credit of CS4980 in the fall and 2 credits of CS4980 in the spring. 


###How do I enroll?

There are three options:

1. Find a CS faculty member who is doing research you're interested in, ask them if they'd be willing to include you on a project, and sign up for their section of CS4980. To get started, take a look at the [available projects](http://research.cs.virginia.edu/).
1. Find a faculty member who is willing to work on a project idea of yours. Once the faculty member agrees to work with you, sign up for their section of CS4980. To start, look at the course offerings of the past several semesters and the [available projects](http://research.cs.virginia.edu/) to identify faculty members with interests that align with your project.
1. Find a friend who is already matched with a faculty member and ask both the friend and the faculty member if you can join that project. Sign up for that faculty member's section of CS4980.

#Which option is best for me?

|If you... |Then you should likely take...|
|--------- |---------------------------------|
|Want to graduate in a fall semester | **Capstone Research**. You *can* complete the Capstone practicum, but you must enroll in CS4970 during the fall of the academic year prior to your graduation.|
|Want to study abroad during your last year | **Capstone Research**. Since the practicum is a two semester sequence, you *cannot* satisfy the capstone requirement if you are away from UVA for either semester.|
|Are considering graduate school | **Capstone Research**, since it provides opportunity for you to gain research experience, and to work more closely with a faculty member (providing a fantastic resource for recommendation letters and general application advice).|
|Want the structure of an organized course | **Capstone Practicum**. This is a formal course with regular deadlines and pre-defined rubrics. Capstone research is likely to be more self-guided.|
|Haven't yet selected either option, and you want to graduate *this* semester | **Capstone Research**. Since each half of the Capstone Practicum is offered once per year, there is no way to finish both portions in a single semester.|

#When should I decide?

Ideally you should speak with your academic advisor about these options at least three semesters before your target graduating semester. If course sign-ups are approaching for the fall before you plan to graduate, and you haven't yet decided, then sign up for CS4970. You can drop that course if you find a faculty member willing to advise you for CS4980 before the drop deadline. At the very latest, you need to have identified early during the semester you take CS4500.

#Frequently Asked Questions

###Can a professor in another department supervise my work and be my instructor for CS4980? 
Only CS faculty members may advise CS4980. Some faculty may be willing to co-advise with faculty from other departments. If a CS faculty member agrees to advise you, enroll for the CS faculty member's section of CS4980.

###Can I take CS4970 in a semester other than Fall, or CS4971 in a semester other than Spring?
No, Each of these are only offered once a year.

###Can I take CS4970/4971 in my third year?
Yes, but there may not be room in the class. Our first priority must be to provide all seats needed by graduating fourth years.

###Can the work I do to satisfy CS4980 be work that I did as part of an internship or part-time job, with someone from the company directing that?
Only CS faculty members may advise CS4980. Some faculty may be willing to co-advise with your employer. If a CS faculty member agrees to advise you, enroll for the CS faculty member's section of CS4980. The project (or portion thereof) used as your capstone must be completed *in addition* to your employment tasks (i.e. you cannot have been paid for doing it), and must be agreed upon by your CS faculty advisor in advance of your internship.

###I took CS4970 during the fall, but I cannot take CS4971 the immediately following spring. What should I do?
You have two options:

1. Take CS4980 to fulfill your capstone requirement instead (CS4970 will still count as a CS elective).
1. Re-take CS4970 the following fall (note that you cannot receive credit for the course twice), then take CS4971 in the immediately following spring.

###My STS Instructor asked me who my technical advisor is. Who is that?

If you are enrolled in CS4970/4971, your technical advisor is the instructor of that course. If you are enrolled in CS4980, then it is the faculty member in whose section you are enrolled. If you are not enrolled in either, then you should find a faculty member who agrees to be your technical advisor ASAP. You will enroll in that instructor's section of CS4980 (either during the current semester or the following).
