This page has the archive of the emails that were sent to the cs-capstone email list for the fall 2020 semester.  The emails are generally (but not always) sent out on Monday of each respective week.


### Week 1 (week of Mon, Aug 24th)

 Hi, all,

As promised, I have posted more details about the capstone process to the capstone page at [http://ugrads.cs.virginia.edu/capstone](http://ugrads.cs.virginia.edu/capstone).  That page also includes a timeline.  All capstone details will be on that page, and this email list will only be used for reminders and notifications.

I have created a Collab workspace that has a Piazza forum that people can use to try to find teammates; note that working in a group is not required (nor is it less work).  In an effort to not clog your inbox with unwanted email (Piazza loves to do that), I did not add any of you to the workspace, but you can add yourself to the Collab workspace -- and thus Piazza -- via [this link](https://collab.its.virginia.edu/portal/site/ef58f425-8e91-45d5-b891-e13cf0094778).

My expectation is to only email this mailing list once a week to summarize what needs to be done and by when.  This is the email is for the first week of classes.

I hope you are all staying healthy!

Best,  
-Aaron Bloomfield


### Week 2 (week of Mon, Aug 31st)

Hi, all,

I hope your semesters are starting off well!  Some notes and updates:

- My plan is to email this list once a week, ideally on Mondays, to keep everybody updated with what's going on, due dates, upcoming schedule, etc.  My intent is that this is often enough to keep everything on track without inundating your inboxes with emails from me.  There will be occasional non-Monday emails as well, but hopefully there will be few of those.
- If you are planning on doing the capstone this fall, then I hope you are able to use this week to generate an idea for your capstone.  You can see possible capstone projects categories on the [capstone page](http://ugrads.cs.virginia.edu/capstone).  Recall that a capstone project has to somehow combine two CS electives.  Pick a project or idea that interests you and go for it.
- There is a [Collab workspace](https://collab.its.virginia.edu/portal/site/ef58f425-8e91-45d5-b891-e13cf0094778) that you are welcome to join if you want to try to find a capstone group.  The main feature of that workspace is a Piazza forum that you can use to find others to work with.  This is completely optional, but is a venue for finding groups.  Keep in mind that capstones can be done individually as well, and the work load does not decrease with increasing group size.
- Next week I'm going to be sending out a survey that all those who want to do the capstone this semester will have to fill out.  Keep in mind that you can always do it in the spring as well.  The survey will ask what two courses you plan to combine in your capstone, who you want to work with (or if you want to work individually), etc.  Sending this out next week is in line with the original schedule, which is on the [capstone page](http://ugrads.cs.virginia.edu/capstone).  The week after I'll release the faculty reviewer assignments, and then we can work through the abstract submission; information on how to write and submit the abstract will be forthcoming when we get to that point.


Best,

### Week 3 (week of Mon, Sep 7th)

 Hi, all,

Welcome to week 3 of the semester!  Some capstone updates:

- Recall that all the capstone information is shown at [http://ugrads.cs.virginia.edu/capstone](http://ugrads.cs.virginia.edu/capstone), and we are currently on track with the timeline listed there.
- For your STS 4500 classes:
    - If you are doing the technical project this fall, then you will have two assigned faculty reviewers in a week or two, and one of them will be the designated one to be listed as your technical advisor.
    - If you are doing the technical project in the spring, then you will list **me** as your technical advisor for STS 4500 this fall, and you will list your assigned faculty reviewer as your technical advisor in the spring in STS 4600.  The technical advisors listed for STS 4500 and for STS 4600 do not have to match.
    - I am still waiting on clarification as to what you should do about listing the *topic* of your technical project if you are doing the technical report in the spring -- I've sent an email out asking about this, and will update when I receive back (right away on [Piazza via the Collab workspace](https://collab.its.virginia.edu/portal/site/ef58f425-8e91-45d5-b891-e13cf0094778/page-reset/bb5bea89-eeec-456c-ba1c-87ab3f2ac8f7), and next week via this weekly email).
- Time to fill out the project matching survey!
    - If you intend to complete the technical project ***this fall***, please fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc-aD4Ml2PSHR5I5i2cma643KpvOJhrsqY-xZS_nKoazRMY8A/viewform).
    - - This has to be filled out by next Monday in order to complete this process this fall.
    - If you intend to complete the technical project ***in the spring***, please fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdUClgqRGqRWZDiCJTOYoVBaoVKKwubN9S0TElIbI0bRM_XeA/viewform).
    - - This lets me know who I have to provide signatures to for their technical reports.
    - Please only fill out ONE OF THEM, not both!


That's all I have for now.  Stay healthy, everybody!  And wear those masks!!!

-Aaron Bloomfield

### Week 4 (week of Mon, Sep 14th)

 Hi, all,

Here's the weekly capstone update for this week!  I hope everybody is staying healthy and safe.

- If you are completing the capstone process this fall, you will need to fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1_vEId1NTuOP6YpE6SKYuMORe7IZwwtkHpm2w5-vhkes/edit) **by the end of the day today.**  Tomorrow morning I'm going to start the faculty matching process.  I hope to have that completed by the end of this week.
- If you are completing the capstone process in the spring, you will need to fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1ZnDxw_nt0NuBfSRt6EZmSfvtmz80iHTkWCYhejAdGXk/edit).
    - Those completing it in the spring will list me as your technical advisor for STS 4500, and you will have a different (and final) faculty member assigned as your technical advisor for STS 4600.  It is not a problem that you will be listing different technical advisors for STS 4500 and STS 4600.
    - I will get in touch with you later in the semester regarding a signature (or, if I haven't gotten in touch with you by the time you need it -- since I don't actually know what the STS deadline is -- send me an email).
    - You will also have to list your technical report idea for STS 4500.  From the person in charge of the STS process, I received the following clarification on this: "those students [will] develop a hypothetical technical topic based on their own interests/what they hope to do in the spring. The topic [can] change once they [start the CS capstone process in the spring], but they wonâ€™t need to revise the prospectus to reflect the next topic."
- Some students have indicated that they do not understand the STS 4500/4600 process or what is required for the completion of the senior thesis.  I have put my understanding of it below in an effort to help clarify the process.  KEEP IN MIND that I am faculty in computer science, not STS, so anything that they say overrides anything that I say.

### Week 5 (week of Mon, Sep 21st)

Hi, all,

The faculty reviewer assignments are ready.  To view them, go to the "CS Capstone" workspace and look in the Posted Feedback tool.  You also will have to start writing an abstract, which I detail below.

**Faculty reviewer assignments:** each group has been assigned two faculty reviewers, a primary and a secondary.  There is no need to contact them just yet, as we have another step (the abstract submissions) to do first.  All the people who requested to be in a group are in those groups; that information is not in the Posted Feedback tool.  And the group number listed is just an internal designation to help me keep everything straight.  I have also included what you submitted for your project description.

**Abstracts:** The next step is for you to write an abstract.  This is a summary of your project, and it should start with what you write in the Google submission form.  I put guidelines to abstract writing below.  Ideally this should be done by next Monday.

Next week you will have to submit your abstracts to a submission system, and I will have that info ready by Monday.

Best,  
-Aaron Bloomfield




__Abstract writing 101__

An abstract is a one or two paragraph summary of a paper or, in this case, of the project you want to write.  You should start with the project description that you submitted, which is also included in the Posted Feedback tool.  The abstract is meant to give an overview of the paper / project.  Although it about a project idea at this point, you are likely to use this abstract in your technical paper later in the semester.

As a start to writing an abstract, look at [this abstract writing guide](https://writing.wisc.edu/handbook/assignments/writing-an-abstract-for-your-research-paper/).  In the "contents of an abstract" section, try writing one sentence on each of those seven enumerated points.  It may be that one or two of those points may require two sentences, but not too many, as you don't want your abstract to be too long.  Then edit (and re-edit!) (and re-edit again!) the abstract until it flows smoothly and you feel it gives and overview.

A note of caution: other classes may have students write to a certain page length, or add "fluff" to a document to make it longer.  Here, "fluff" is when extra verbiage is added that does nothing to be informative but just adds length.  Of course you all would never do this, but you may have friends who have done this.  As a general rule, CS faculty tend to not like fluffy abstracts, as it's just a waste of everybody's time -- it wastes your time writing it and our time reading it.  I've made students completely rewrite their technical reports because they added it a lot of fluff.  We are looking for short, concise, and to the point.  That being said, it should still be correct English and explain everything well.  Just don't try to add length for the sake of adding length.

Lastly, keep in mind that writing a good abstract is a bit of an art form, and nobody expects you all to be experts on this, as this is likely the first abstract that you will have written.  So give it your best shot, don't stress too much over it, and I'll send out instructions on Monday about how to submit the abstracts.

I would expect that writing and editing the abstract would take an hour or two.  Your mileage may vary, of course.



### Week 6 (week of Mon, Sep 28th)


Hi, all,

Sorry this update is a day late.  I explain why below, if you are interested.

**Action required:** please enter your abstracts into the form [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYyG4SisoqyeBUs3_gTKsjBEK0LUY3bk9V7YzuXVjWzihuWA/viewform).  Presumably you have been working on them since my email last week.  Keep in mind that they don't need to be perfect -- just as well polished as you are able to do.  If you haven't written it yet, then please do so ASAP.  This is not a high stress task -- neither your capstone, nor your graduation, nor your happiness and success in life will depend on the quality of this first draft, so just do your best.  See my email from last Wednesday for directions for how to write it.

Please only enter ONE form submission per team group.  **They are due by the end of this Friday (10/2).**  As you have (presumably) worked on them, it should just be a quick cut-and-paste into that form.

This weekend I will send them to the faculty, and then you can start chatting with them about the next steps -- how to start that conversation will be the subject of my update next Monday.

Best,  
-Aaron Bloomfield




The original intent was to use an actual conference submission system, such as [HotCRP](https://hotcrp.com/) (yes, it's pronounced as "hot crap").  But I don't feel that we need most of the additional features that it provides, and will just add complexity and confusion, so I decided to ditch that option.  But it took a while to figure out how to manage the various aspects internally, hence the delay in getting this week's update out on time.  That, and the fact that I was backpacking the Appalachian Trail this past weekend might have had something to do with it as well...
