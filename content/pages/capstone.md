## Capstone Information for AY 2022-2023

Fourth year students need to do the following to complete their CS capstone / senior thesis:

1. Take STS 4500 in the fall and STS 4600 in the spring.
2. Complete your CS capstone / senior thesis requirement in one of two ways:
 
Option 1) Take 3 credits of CS 4980 (or CS 4993) and write a "significant technical paper" at the end of this course.  Whoever you take CS 4980 with will sign off on the paper as being your technical report component for your senior thesis portfolio that you do with STS during 4500 and 4600.  Reach out to faculty to see what projects they may have or check out http://research.cs.virginia.edu for ideas!

Option 2) Take a 6th CS elective (CS 3000 or higher) -AND- take the 0-credit CS 4991 course.  The 6th CS elective will cover your required 3 credits needed for the capstone slot in your SIS Academic Requirements report.  CS 4991 is the course in which we track and evaluate a "significant technical paper" that you come up with on your own.  This course is pass/fail and you need a pass to graduate.

## Frequently Asked Questions

__Q:__ Who is teaching CS 4991?            
__A:__ CS 4991 is being taught this fall and spring by Prof. Rosanne Vrugtman.  She is a professional writer and editor and did a fantastic job helping students with their technical reports last year.

__Q:__ Does CS 4991 have any meeting times?      
__A:__ No, but Prof. Vrugtman will probably hold some occasional meeting times if you would like to come discuss your report or hear more about how to structure your paper.

__Q:__ How do I come up with my paper topic?      
__A:__ Here are two prompts to consider:      
- Describe an already completed computing experiential learning event ― internship, personal project, non-profit volunteer effort ― that offered documented value to a specific organization, community, or group. If appropriate, indicate how the project could be enhanced or redesigned for increased value.
- Propose a synthesis of ideas from two completed CS courses that connects how topic(s) might be enhanced, extended, refined, or reworked.

__Q:__ Can I ask Prof. Vrugtman questions about my technical paper?      
__A:__ About the writing, yes.  About the content, no.  Prof. Vrugtman is great, but she's a professional editor, not a computer scientist.  If you have technical questions, it would be best to run them past CS faculty that have expertise in the area.  We will inform faculty that these questions may be coming and to help you when they can.

__Q:__ Do I have to take CS 4991 in the fall or can I take it in the spring?      
__A:__ It doesn't matter which semester you take it.  Prof. Vrugtman will take half of the BSCS students who want to do this option this fall and the other half in the spring.  If you want to do it in the fall, it may already be full, but you can see if someone wants to drop or swap.

__Q:__ I don't want to do a 6th elective and would prefer research or an independent project.      
__A:__ Great!  You can go to http://research.cs.virginia.edu to see a list of potential projects or ideas.  Even if the idea was posted a while ago, if you think it sounds cool, reach out to the professor!  They may still be working on that project or have other ideas based on your interests!  It never hurts to reach out to our faculty to talk about their research or your project ideas.

__Q:__ Does my CS 4980 independent project have to come from http://research.cs.virginia.edu?      
__A:__ Absolutely not!  Consider that site a starting point.  Reach out to folks and ask about your ideas as well!

Below is information regrading the BS CS capstone process for the 2021-2022 academic year.  This one page is currently maintained by Aaron Bloomfield.


## What is the process for the BS CS capstone?

This is actually two separate questions: the capstone requirement and the technical report itself.  And this only applies to the 2021-2022 academic year.

**Capstone requirement:** The BS CS major has a capstone requirement where every student has to take a 3 credit capstone course.  Previously this was limited to CS 4980 (Capstone Research) and CS 4971 (Capstone Practicum II).  For the upcoming academic year (2021-2022), you can take *any* CS 4000-level elective to fulfill this requirement.

**Technical report:** The technical report is required by STS 4600.  The department is working on a means to allow for the relatively easy completion of your technical reports.  The technical report aspect will not require a separate class (other than what was described above), nor will it require a separate project (like it did this year).  We do not expect to have that information ready until the start of the fall 2021 semester.

## So now I have to take *six* CS electives?

Well, yes, but only if you look at it a certain way.

Previously the requirement was that you needed 5 CS electives (3 credits each) and one capstone course (3 credits).  Now you can take any 4000-level CS elective as your capstone course.  So the number of courses (6) and credits (18) hasn't changed -- you can just take a wider selection of courses to fulfill your capstone requirement.

In effect, you do have to take 6 CS electives (at least one being at the 4000-level).  But if you look at it that way, though, then you don't have to take a separate capstone course.

## Can I use a previously taken CS 4000-level elective as my capstone course?

Yes!  Technically you only have to take one CS 4000-level elective to graduate.  In practice, though, there aren't enough 3000-level electives offered to allow for one 4000-level elective and the remaining five electives being 3000-level.

## Will I need a SIS exception for the 4000-level elective to count as my capstone course?

Nope!  SIS will be reconfigured to do this automatically.  Yay, SIS!

## So what about the technical report?

The technical report is required as part of STS 4600; it is not a CS requirement, but the CS department is the entity that approves the report.

We have not finalized the details for the technical report for the 2021-2022 academic year, so we are hesitant to release too many details when those details may yet change.  But here is what we can say at this point.

The technical report is *likely* to be an existing artifact (report) that you wrote in a previously taken CS elective, and can also be a separate (short) report that you write on some aspect of your work as a CS student (perhaps as an internship).  We are working on finalizing the guidelines and example report topics for this.  More information will be known by the start of the fall 2021 semester.

## Can I still take CS 4980 (Capstone Research)?

Sure -- that will count as your capstone course, and you will have to take 5 other CS electives.

## Will CS 4970/4971 (Capstone Practicum I & II) ever be offered ever again?

Likely not.  The problem is that the course did not scale well with the growth of the majors.

## What is the capstone process if I want to graduate in August of 2021?

I am working on getting clarification on this.  More information to follow once I receive it.

## What is the capstone process if I want to graduate in August of 2022?

We will know this much later, likely in early 2022.
