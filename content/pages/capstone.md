This page lists the frequently asked questions regrading the BS CS capstone process for the 2021-2022 academic year.  This one page is currently maintained by Aaron Bloomfield.


## What is the process for the BS CS capstone?

This is actually two separate questions: the capstone requirement and the technical report itself.  And this only applies to the 2021-2022 academic year.

**Capstone requirement:** The BS CS major has a capstone requirement where every student has to take a 3 credit capstone course.  Previously this was limited to CS 4980 (Capstone Research) and CS 4971 (Capstone Practicum II).  For the upcoming academic year (2021-2022), you can take *any* CS 4000-level elective to fulfill this requirement.

**Technical report:** The technical report is required by STS 4600.  The department is working on a means to allow for the relatively easy completion of your technical reports.  The technical report aspect will not require a separate class (other than what was described above), nor will it require a separate project (like it did this year).  We do not expect to have that information ready until the start of the fall 2021 semester.

## So now I have to take *six* CS electives?

Well, yes, but only if you look at it a certain way.

Previously the requirement was that you needed 5 CS electives (3 credits each) and one capstone course (3 credits).  Now you can take any 4000-level CS elective as your capstone course.  So the number of courses (6) and credits (18) hasn't changed -- you can just take a wider selection of courses to fulfill your capstone requirement.

In effect, you do have to take 6 CS electives (at least one being at the 4000-level).  But if you look at it that way, though, then you don't have to take a separate capstone course.

## Can I use a previously taken CS 4000-level elective as my capstone course?

Yes!  Technically you only have to take one CS 4000-level elective to graduate.  In practice, though, there aren't enough 3000-level electives offered to allow for one 4000-level elective and the remaining five electives being 3000-level.

## Will I need a SIS exception for the 4000-level elective to count as my capstone course?

Nope!  SIS will be reconfigured to do this automatically.  Yay, SIS!

## So what about the technical report?

The technical report is required as part of STS 4600; it is not a CS requirement, but the CS department is the entity that approves the report.

We have not finalized the details for the technical report for the 2021-2022 academic year, so we are hesitant to release too many details when those details may yet change.  But here is what we can say at this point.

The technical report is *likely* to be an existing artifact (report) that you wrote in a previously taken CS elective, and can also be a separate (short) report that you write on some aspect of your work as a CS student (perhaps as an internship).  We are working on finalizing the guidelines and example report topics for this.  More information will be known by the start of the fall 2021 semester.

## Can I still take CS 4980 (Capstone Research)?

Sure -- that will count as your capstone course, and you will have to take 5 other CS electives.

## Will CS 4970/4971 (Capstone Practicum I & II) ever be offered ever again?

Likely not.  The problem is that the course did not scale well with the growth of the majors.

## What is the capstone process if I want to graduate in August of 2021?

I am working on getting clarification on this.  More information to follow once I receive it.

## What is the capstone process if I want to graduate in August of 2022?

We will know this much later, likely in early 2022.
