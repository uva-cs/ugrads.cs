title: Curricular Practical Training (CPT)

Undergraduates sometimes ask faculty to give them course credit as part of a program called Curricular Practical Training (CPT),
where students do a paid internship but also must sign up for credit.  We have seen an uptick in questions as to whether a student 
can get CS 4993 credit for CPT (it is getting to be internship season after all!).

The UGCC [CS Department Undergrad Committee] reviewed this and has decided that CS 4993 (or any other CS course) is not appropriate
for CPT, and that faculty should 
not sign undergraduates up for a CS course for CPT in the future.

A major factor in this is that the university offers a course UNST 2820 specifically for undergrads who need CPT. The person who 
coordinates this class has been Kimberly Link <khl3r@virginia.edu>, who is Associate Director of the Internship Center.  A course 
description for UNST 2820 is listed at the end of this.

The International Studies Office has told us that a student on CPT should never receive credit for the employment experience itself.
That would be contrary to university standards.  The reason we as a department do not allow CS 4993 to count for CPT or any 
other internship is because CS 4993's course description states that it for an “in-depth study of a computer science or 
computer engineering problem by an individual student in close consultation with departmental faculty.”  Most often the 
activity related to the student's internship does not meet this description; the work done for most paid internships 
does usually not involve our faculty in any way. Up to three credits of CS 4993 can count as an upper-level elective 
for our computing degrees, and it is important that all credits given for CS 4993 are at the appropriate level.  

If a student wants to do a separate project based upon his or her internship work and is then fully supervised by a 
CS faculty member, then that’s a good use for CS 4993 credit.
