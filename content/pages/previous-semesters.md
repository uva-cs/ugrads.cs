Information for Spring 2020
---------------------------

The Provost announced that this semester there will be a GC grade and stated that "GC counts toward degree requirements that don't require a C or higher." The CS department's understanding of this statement, which we intend to use for all CS class prereqs and CS-administered majors and minors (i.e. BACS, BSCS, CpE, and CS minors), is as follows:

- If you have a CR grade, it meets any requirement a C would meet. This includes "class X with C- or better" prereqs.
- If you have a GC grade, it meets any requirement a D- would meet. This includes "class X" prereqs that do not list a required grade, as well as degree requirements to complete specific courses or gain certain numbers of credits in specific course areas.
- If you have a NC grade, it does not meet any requirements.

In answer to some specific questions we have been asked:

- As officially defined in [the record](http://records.ureg.virginia.edu/content.php?catoid=47&navoid=3494), no BACS, BSCS, or CpE graduation requirement requires a specific grade in any given course, so for graduation GC is sufficient for all courses (required and elective, in-department and external, including special offerings like capstones, independent study, etc).
- Both [BSCS](http://records.ureg.virginia.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=47&poid=5916) and [CpE](records.ureg.virginia.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=47&poid=5914&returnto=3494) officially define "unrestricted elective" using the language "any graded course in the University;" for Spring 2020, a "graded course" is one where letter grades are an option. If a student earns a CR or GC in such a course, that will satisfy this requirement.
- All of this applies to the Spring 2020 redefinition of CR/GC/NC, not to CR/NC as it existed before then.
